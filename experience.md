* __Extreme Engineering Solutions__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associate Embedded Engineer, Linux Team   
_Co-ops were treated as full members of the team, so there were no special side projects for us.  Was able to work on a wide variety of software and hardware.  A short list includes software releases, finding bug fixes for customer support issues, a Python script using Docker to let employees build initramfs in a virtual environment, instead of having to find a board with the right processor, internal tool feature additions, Linux kernel driver improvements, and more._

* __UW Athletic Food & Beverage Dept.__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caterer/Bartender/Truck Driver  
_Tended bar during athletic events for commercial and private groups.  Also drove the food delivery truck on game days to make sure the hundreds of pounds of food were distributed around the hectic game day campus safely and efficiently.  Drunk students in the road make this much harder than it sounds._

* __UW Housing Dept.__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dining Hall Team Member  
_Food service was the name of the game here. Worked with chefs to prepare food for the hundreds of students coming through every meal, as well as working grills and various other stations out in the heart of the action._

* __Quality Moving & Storage__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mover  
_Residential and commercial mover throughout the greater Twin Cities metro.  Worked 6 days a week with some days reaching 13,14, and once 17 hours. Long hours required a positive attitude to offset the employees who would easily become grouchy and nothing make a day feel slower than being unhappy at work._

* __Walmart__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truck Unloader  
_Unloaded semis of product in small teams.  Also tasked with picking and bringing out pallets of items that needed to be stocked._

* __CEC Theatres__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concessions/Usher  
_Prepped and served concessions for hundreds of customers every showtime.  Had to learn to find workarounds to problems, since tools/appliances you need will always break when you need it thanks to Murphy's Law._
