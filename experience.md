* __Propeller Health__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software Engineer Intern  
_Was able to work on a wide variety of projects thanks to the goal of my mananger to make sure everything I do is valuable not only to the company, but also to my personal development and learning. In my first week their I adapted a project I've worked on in the past ([Ansible Laptop Configuration](/projects)) to simplify the onboarding setup they had in place for new hires. I worked alongside two hardware interns to build a robot that would alleviate pain points in the lives of our QA team, the software consisted of a Node.js server serving a web interface that ran a worker Python process on a Raspberry Pi.  I also had the opportunity to build a Slack bot with AWS SAM to gain more experience with serverless architectures; it simplified an annoying process for accessing data from the Tableau server. After being given free reign to to try and learn about security and test the Propeller applications, I was able to discover a critical vulnerability in the API and build a proof of concept (based on work i found from a security researcher).  The DevOps team let me help out with some small changes to Jenkins to get a feel for how it works._

* __Extreme Engineering Solutions__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associate Embedded Engineer, Linux Team  
_Co-ops were treated as full members of the team, so there were no burner projects to toil on.  I was able to work with a wide variety of software and hardware technologies, from the linux kernel and U-Boot to working with the Python Flask microframework. My tasks involved software releases, finding bug fixes for customer support issues, a Python wrapper around Docker for easily accessible cross-platform environments such as powerpc/ARM, internal tool feature additions, Linux kernel driver improvements, and anyting else that would benefit the team._

* __UW Athletic Food & Beverage Dept.__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caterer/Bartender/Truck Driver  
_Tended bar during athletic events for commercial and private groups.  Also drove the food delivery truck on game days to make sure the hundreds of pounds of food were distributed around the hectic game day campus safely and efficiently.  Drunk students in the road make this much harder than it sounds._

* __UW Housing Dept.__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dining Hall Team Member  
_Food service was the name of the game here. Worked with chefs to prepare food for the hundreds of students coming through every meal, as well as working grills and various other stations out in the heart of the action._

* __Quality Moving & Storage__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mover  
_Residential and commercial mover throughout the greater Twin Cities metro.  Worked 6 days a week with some days reaching 13,14, and once 17 hours. Long hours required a positive attitude to offset the employees who would easily become grouchy and nothing make a day feel slower than being unhappy at work._

* __Walmart__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truck Unloader  
_Unloaded semis of product in small teams.  Also tasked with picking and bringing out pallets of items that needed to be stocked._

* __CEC Theatres__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concessions/Usher  
_Prepped and served concessions for hundreds of customers every showtime.  Had to learn to find workarounds to problems, since tools/appliances you need will always break when you need it thanks to Murphy's Law._
