The reason for this blog is that hopefully someday, the struggles I have gone through or solutions I have found will be that random blog post in the corner of the internet that solves some poor exasperated souls issue.  I've found enough posts in my time that end with 'I figured it out' and no explanation that I will not let those future frustrated furrowed brow reach a dead end with an isssue I've solved.  They will never know who I am, but the chance I can save them is worth the effort of writing these posts.
