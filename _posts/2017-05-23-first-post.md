The reason for this blog is that hopefully someday, the struggles I have gone through or solutions I have found will be that random blog post in the corner of the internet that solves some poor exasperated souls issue.  I've found enough posts in my time that end with 'I figured it out' and no explanation that I will not let those future frustrated furrowed brows reach a dead end with an isssue I've solved.  They will never know who I am, but the chance I can save them is worth the effort of writing these posts.  

It's the least I can do for the uncountable number of blogs and Stack Overflow posts that have answered my questions.
