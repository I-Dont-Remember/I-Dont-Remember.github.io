My [Github](https://github.com/I-Dont-Remember) is the best place to view projects I have worked on, am working on, or have on my list of want-tos.

* #### sms2sheets
  * Connects the Twilio SMS API with the Google Sheets API to let me input data into my finance sheet when I don't have wifi or my laptop.  Flask server running from a Docker image on AWS, [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) for the graphs.  Depending on when this is being read, it should have a front end input to the sheet as well as charts to display information from the sheet.  Would like to eventually rework the sheets connection act more like a database, whereas right now the structure of the sheet is what I was using when I was manually inputting all the data.

* ### Copundrum
  * [Link](https://i-dont-remember.github.io/copundrum/)
  * Chat bot project from the MadHacks Hackathon (Spring 2017).  Got the Iphone theme from Codepen and created the bot to have a variety of words it watches out for, and if it doesn't know how to process it responds with either a pun or uses the Giphy API to respond with a (hopefully) relevant gif.  We also incorporated the ability for it to play tic tac toe.

* ### This Website
  * Uses a neat theme made for Github pages and Jekyll.

* ### My Previous Site
  * [Link](https://i-dont-remember.github.io/PersonalSite/)
  * First attempt at web development.  Decided on Bootstrap since it made life so much easier, without it I would have been even less of a fan of CSS than I already am.

* ### W.E. Sorter
  * White elephant name sorting program.  People at work had brought up the possibility, and it was one of the first times I finally saw where programming could solve a problem in my life.

* ### Text2Vote
  * On hold until sms2sheets is done to our satisfaction. Goal is to use that knowledge of Twilio and gspread to make a small voting application for use with the Gymnastics Club.

* ### Personal Scripts
  * Repo I use to hold scripts I end up writing for use on my home machine.
