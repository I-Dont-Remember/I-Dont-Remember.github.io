### Assistant Coach
When I am back home with my family I assist my dad in coaching a youth socccer team. This summer they were able to take second at the MYSA state championship tournament.

### Bad Company Airsoft Team

I don't get to consistently play, thanks to living in a city now, but when we get the opportunity my friends and I love to grab our gear and head out for airsoft matches at local courses.  

### Rec Sports Involvement
Each fall is the time for UW RecSports soccer, then in the winter is futsal.  The team I play on has a very strong upward trend in our record, from 0 wins our first season to now averaging 1 whole win!
We play with a number of friends who never played until college, but the fun we have offsets any loss of championship tshirts... for the most part.  

### UW-Madison Gymnastics Club

Joined the club two years ago on a whim to try new things with a couple of friends, and we've been in it ever since.  It's an awesome way to keep motivation for working out. The more you do the neater the tricks you can pull off.
